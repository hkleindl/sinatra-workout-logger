# sinatra-workout-logger

Welcome to Workout Logger!

Workout Logger is a small Sinatra application used to keep track of your workouts. You will be able to sign up with your own account, create new workouts and add exercises to each workout.

To get started, change the current directory to `sinatra-workout-logger`, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, then `shotgun`.
